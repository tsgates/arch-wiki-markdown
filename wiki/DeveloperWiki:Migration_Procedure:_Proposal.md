Migration Procedure: Proposal
=============================

I'd like to get a discussion going here about the "proper procedure" for
migrating large changes from Testing to Current

This document is not intended to point fingers, or place blame.

The following outline should be followed before moving major changes
into current:

-   Clean your personal test machine back to the [current] package set
    -   building with pacbuild will ensure dependenies are right -

-   Reinstall [testing], verifying all steps are documented somewhere
    (ideally, the wiki)
-   Post a main page announcement, add announcement to the Announcements
    forum, with a link
-   Move packages ( possibly shut off rsync at first? not sure )
    -   there's always a major strain on bandwidth when we turn it back
        on, maybe rsync mirrors or temporarily allow more bandwidth
        usage?

... discuss, change, whatever, as you see fit, I'm just trying to get
things flowing here
