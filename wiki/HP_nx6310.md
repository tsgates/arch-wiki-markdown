HP nx6310
=========

Arch Linux is currently running successfully on this laptop. As of
February 2007, it is the only linux distribution I have tried which
correctly reports the battery/power status. This is the version with a
Celeron M processor, and originally with 256MB RAM and no wireless. I've
since upgraded to 1GB RAM and the Intel 3945 Wireless which is the
standard card for other nx6310s which come with it.

wireless

To enable the Intel 3945 Wireless card I had to install the ipw3945
package. I then added ipw3945 to the MODULES section of rc.conf and
ipw3945d to the DAEMONS section before network. I use NetworkManager to
handle the mutiple wireless networks I need to connect to and there were
issues with no wireless devices showing up in KNetworkManager. There
were two different causes of this:

-   My user wasn't part of the users group
-   You need to turn the wireless card on by pressing the button next to
    the power button - this isn't needed everytime I boot up so I'm not
    sure what the pattern is

sound

Worked out of the box
