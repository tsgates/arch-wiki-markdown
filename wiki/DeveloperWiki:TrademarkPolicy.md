Trademark Policy
================

The objective of the Arch Linux trademark policy is to encourage
widespread use of the Arch Linux trademarks by the Arch Linux community
while controlling that use in order to avoid confusion on the part of
Arch Linux users and the general public, to maintain the value of the
image and reputation of the trademarks and to protect them from
inappropriate or unauthorised use.

The sections below describe what is allowed, what isn't allowed, and
cases in which you should ask permission. If you have any doubt, please
contact us at trademarks@archlinux.org.

> The Trademarks

Aaron Griffin (hereinafter the "Arch Linux Project Lead") and Judd
Vinet, on behalf of Arch Linux, own a number of trademarks including
"ARCHLINUX", "ARCH LINUX", "A simple, lightweight Linux distribution"
and the stylized Arch Linux logo. The trademarks are recognized in both
word and logo form. Any mark beginning with the letters ARCH is
sufficiently similar to one or more of the trademarks that permission
will be needed in order to use it. This policy encompasses all marks, in
word and logo form (collectively referred to as "Trademarks").

> Permitted Use

Certain usages of the Trademarks are fine and no specific permission
from us is needed.

Advocacy. Arch Linux is built by, and largely for, its community. We
share access to the Trademarks with the entire community for the
purposes of discussion, development and advocacy. We recognise that most
of the open source discussion and development areas are for
non-commercial purposes and will allow the use of the Trademarks in this
context, provided:

-   the Trademark is used in a manner consistent with the Usage
    Guidelines below
-   there is no commercial intent behind the use
-   what you are referring to is in fact Arch Linux. If someone is
    confused into thinking that what isn't Arch Linux is in fact Arch
    Linux, you are probably doing something wrong.
-   there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your
    project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its
    related projects unless it has been approved by and is accountable
    to the Arch Linux Project Lead

Derived works. The ability to customise Arch Linux to meet your specific
needs is one of the great strengths of free software in general, and
Arch Linux in particular. While we encourage customisation and
derivation of Arch Linux, we must balance that freedom with the
integrity of the Trademarks and the quality which they represent. To
help reach that balance, we have established the following guidelines
and definitions.

We recognise and encourage the concept of a "remix." Remixes are derived
versions of Arch Linux, and it is intended that any software and
hardware certifications will apply to a Remix. Therefore the changes
from official Arch Linux products must be minimal to be permitted to use
the Trademarks. These changes can include configuration changes through
the existing Arch Linux configuration management tools, changes to
artwork and graphical themes and some variance in package selection. In
general, a Remix can have applications from the Arch Linux archives
added, or default applications removed, but removing or changing any
infrastructure components (e.g., shared libraries or desktop components)
will result in changes too large for the resulting product to be called
by a Trademark. Note that if the nature of the product's divergence from
Arch Linux changes, the Remix naming and Trademark use may no longer
apply.

Therefore, if you are creating a derivative of Arch Linux, you may use
the Trademarks in association with the software product provided:

-   the changes are minimal and unsubstantial, as described above
-   there is no commercial intent associated with the new product
-   the Trademark is used in a way that makes it clear that your project
    is a development effort related to the Arch Linux source, but that
    the software you are working upon is not in fact Arch Linux as
    distributed by the Arch Linux project
-   there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your
    project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its
    related projects unless it has been approved by and is governed by
    the Arch Linux Project Lead.

If you are producing a new product which is based on Arch Linux but
which has more substantial changes than those described above as a
Remix, you are allowed to state (and we would encourage you to do so)
that your product is "derived from Arch Linux", "based on Arch Linux",
or "a derivative of Arch Linux" but you may not use the Trademarks to
refer to your product. In some cases you may be allowed to use the
Trademarks, but permission must be explicitly granted by the Arch Linux
Project Lead. In that event, these products will need a trademark
license, and such a license can be revoked if the nature of your
divergence from Arch Linux changes. Products which include very invasive
changes, such as a new kernel, the inclusion of packages which are not
part of the Arch Linux repositories, or anything else that significantly
impacts the technical quality or user experience would fall into this
category are unlikely to be approved. (Note that if you are including
packages which are not part of the Arch Linux repositories, we encourage
you to work within the community processes, such as the Arch User
Repository (AUR) to submit and maintain those packages within the
community repositories in order to minimise this issue.)

Building on Arch Linux or for Arch Linux. If you are producing new
software which is intended for use with or on Arch Linux, you may use
the trademark in a way which indicates the intent of your product. For
example, if you are developing a system management tool for Arch Linux,
acceptable project titles would be "System Management for Arch Linux" or
"Arch Linux Based Systems Management". We would strongly discourage, and
likely would consider to be problematic, a name such as ArchMan, Arch
Management, ArchTools, etc. Furthermore, you may not use the Trademarks
in a way which implies an endorsement where that doesn't exist, or which
attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand
of the project.

Commentary and parody. The Arch Linux Trademarks are designed to cover
use of a mark to imply origin or endorsement by the project. When a user
downloads something called Arch Linux, they should know it comes from
the Arch Linux project. This helps Arch Linux build a reputation that
will not be damaged by confusion around what is, and isn't, Arch Linux.
Using the Trademarks in your discussion, commentary, criticism or
parody, in ways that unequivocally do not imply endorsement, is
permissible. Anyone is free to write articles, create websites, blog
about, or talk about Arch Linux -- as long as it's clear to everyone --
including people completely unfamiliar with Arch Linux -- that they are
simply referring to Arch Linux and in no way speaking for the Arch Linux
project.

We reserve the right to review all usage within the open source
community, and to object to any usage that appears to overstep the
bounds of discussion and good-faith non-commercial development. In any
event, once a project has left the open source project phase or
otherwise become a commercial project, this policy does not authorize
any use of the Trademarks in connection to that project.

> Restricted use that requires a trademark license

Explicit permission from the Arch Linux Project Lead is necessary to use
any of the Trademarks under any circumstances other than those
specifically permitted above. These include:

-   Any commercial use.
-   Use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is
    built on top of a product supplied by us, if there is any commercial
    intent associated with that product.
-   Use for merchandising purposes, e.g. on t-shirts and the like.
-   Services relating to any of the above.

If you wish to have permission for any of the uses above or for any
other use which is not specifically referred to in this policy, please
email trademarks@archlinux.org and we'll let you know as soon as
possible if your proposed use is permissible. Permission may only be
granted subject to certain conditions and these may include the
requirement that you enter into an agreement with us to maintain the
quality of the product and/or service which you intend to supply at a
prescribed level.

While there may be exceptions, it is very unlikely that we will approve
Trademark use in the following cases:

-   Use of a Trademark in a company name.
-   Use of a Trademark in a domain name which has a commercial intent.
    The commercial intent can range from promotion of a company or
    product, to collecting revenue generated by advertising.
-   The calling of any software or product by the name Arch Linux (or
    another related Trademark), unless that software or product is a
    substantially unmodified Arch Linux product, or properly labelled as
    a "Remix" as described above.
-   Use in combination with any other marks or logos. This include use
    of a Trademark in a manner that creates a "combined mark," or use
    that integrates other wording with the Trademark in a way that the
    public may think of the use as a new mark (for example Club Arch
    Linux or ArchBooks, or in a way that by use of special fonts or
    presentation with nearby words or images conveys an impression that
    the two are tied in some way).
-   Use in combination with any product or service which is presented as
    being Certified or Official or formally associated with us or our
    products or services.
-   Use in a way which implies an endorsement where that doesn't exist,
    or which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the
    goodwill or brand of the project.
-   Use of a Trademark in a manner that disparages Arch Linux and is not
    clearly third-party parody.
-   On or in relation to a software product which constitutes a
    substantially modified version of a product supplied by the Arch
    Linux project, that is to say with material changes to the code, or
    services relating to such a product.
-   In a title or metatag of a web page whose primary intention or
    result is to influence search engine rankings or result listings,
    rather than for discussion, development or advocacy of the
    Trademarks.

> Logo Usage Guidelines

In addition to the restrictions imposed above, the Trademark declaration
( ™ ) must remain intact whenever displaying the logos.

Our logos are presented in multiple colours and it is important that
their visual integrity be maintained. It is therefore preferable that
the logos only be used in their standard form but if you should feel the
need to alter them in any way, please keep the following in mind:

-   Any scaling should retain the original proportions of the logo.
-   A monochrome version (white, black, etc.) should be used in certain
    situations, such as when applying it to colourful or "busy"
    backdrops that would otherwise make the logo difficult to read.
