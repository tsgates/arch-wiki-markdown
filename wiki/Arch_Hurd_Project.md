Arch Hurd Project
=================

The Arch Hurd Project is a port of Arch Linux to the GNU Hurd platform.
It was founded on 2010-01-04 by Michael Walker (Barrucadu) and, with
input from a variety of people including Allan McRae (allan), Matthias
Lanzinger (melpo), and Alexander Preisinger (giselher), the project has
made excellent process (as of 2010-08-24). The Hurd is GNU's quest for
the perfect free software kernel and despite that, unfortunately, is
quite often neglected, even by GNU developers themselves - as can be
seen by the extensive number of patches on important packages (such as
glibc) in the repositories. The Hurd is a microkernel running a
collection of servers which implement the rest of the functionality of a
Unix kernel.

Despite having no SATA, USB, PCMCIA or sound support, Arch Hurd has
gained a small following of interested users and hackers, and continues
to accelerate in development (a trend which may decline with the start
of the next academic year).
