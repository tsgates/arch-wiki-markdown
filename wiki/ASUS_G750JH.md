> UEFI

The G750 is a UEFI device, but can also boot from a partition with the
"boot" flag set in the traditional manner. Both UEFI and legacy boot
methods work with syslinux using the instructions on the wiki here.

> Graphics

Works fine with nvidia from the official repositories. The nouveau
driver has not yet been tested.

HDMI port

HDMI video output works using the proprietary video driver. HDMI audio
output works using pulseaudio.

VGA port

Works using the proprietary video driver.

> Touchpad

Does not quite work out-of-the-box with xf86-input-synaptics from the
official repositories. The touchpad is mistakenly recognized as a
click-pad, leading to the right mouse button being disabled and some
other strange behaviour. A fix to enable the right physical button is
available here.

To remedy the other strange behaviour (a left-click is interpreted as a
right-click if a finger is touching the lower-right area of the
touchpad), the following options are required:

    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

            Option "SoftButtonAreas" "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
            Option "RTCornerButton" "0" #right-click to bottom right

> USB 3

All USB ports work fine with no configuration required.

> Optical drive

Can read from and write to CD/DVD media with no configuration required.
BD-ROM reading has not yet been tested.

> Sound

The integrated stero microphones work out-of-the-box with PulseAudio.
The headphone and microphone ports also behave as expected. To get the
bass speaker working, it is necessary to enable 2.1 sound in PulseAudio:

    /etc/pulse/daemon.conf

            default-sample-channels = 3
            enable-lfe-remixing = yes

alsamixer maps the bass speaker to the "Speaker" channel, and maps the
left and right speakers to the "Headphone" channel. PulseAudio jack
detection can interfere with this configuration; to disable it, comment
out this line:

    /etc/pulse/default.pa

            # load-module module-switch-on-port-available

> Webcam

Works fine with no configuration required. The webcam records at a
higher framerate than the sensor on the G73 and is actually usable, but
it isn't anything special.

> SD card reader

Works fine with no configuration required. Note that the G750 is unable
to boot from the card reader, even in legacy mode.

> Networking

LAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

WLAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

Bluetooth

Works fine using bluez with no configuration required.
