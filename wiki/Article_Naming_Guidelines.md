Article naming is one of the most important tasks for wiki writers and
editors. This article is a complete guideline on choosing appropriate
article names, and also presents ArchWiki writers and editors with some
issues to consider when naming their articles.

About article names
-------------------

Article names serve two purposes. They are identifiers of the wiki
content on the ArchWiki site. Also, they are means by which readers
identify the content. Therefore, an article name has to be unique and
descriptive.

Sometimes, article names reflect the type of article content, and also
offer additional information like language in which the article was
written.

Descriptive names
-----------------

Names should be as specific as possible, and they should reflect the
article scope.

Documentation projects are seldom like software/hardware reviews
commonly seen in newspapers and news sites. Documentation is usually
read when some problem arises, or some other specific need has to be
met. Therefore, quick identification of those needs and swift solution
is of utmost importance. For improved readability and faster access to
information, article names (and, therefore, their titles) should be as
descriptive and specific as the article scope permits.

> Example

Titles like Boost Pacman may be misleading for most readers. Some of the
readers may be looking to boost some aspect of pacman, and that aspect
may not necessarily be the aspect described in the article. Therefore,
the article name must be as specific as possible without being too long
to quickly scan. Such an article may be renamed to read How to improve
pacman download speed using wget, snarf, and lftp.

Allowing for article enhancement
--------------------------------

Names should be general enough to allow for future enhancement of the
article contents.

In order to allow room for future edits and enhancements, an article's
name sometimes needs to be less specific. Of course, making article
names less specific just for the sake of shortening it is not a good
idea. On the other hand, if you think you have covered all the bases,
and that no future edits will enhance the article's scope, make your
article's name as specific as possible.

> Example

Let us go back to the previous example. The new title of the article is
Improve pacman download speed using wget, snarf, and lftp. However, some
day, new download mangers may emerge that would replace or become an
alternative to wget, snarf, and/or lftp. This calls for a more generic
title, something like: How to improve pacman download speed using
alternative download managers.

Shorten article names
---------------------

Names should be as short as possible.

Making article names short is important in order to allow quick scanning
of article listings. Many people use the browsing technique when reading
wikis, so you do not want to waste their time by writing article names
that are miles long. Also, shorter names tend to sound more
professional.

For this article, we will use this name as an example:

-   How to improve pacman download speed using alternative download
    managers

We will cover a few techniques that will help us shorten the name. There
are probably many more techniques that do not apply to this particular
example, but you will still get insight into the concept of title
editing.

Warning:Literal translation of this article may prove to be a challenge
for most languages. Please try to find alternative titles that may serve
better for your language. Also, other languages may require different
techniques than English.

> Avoid using question form

Instead of saying How to improve, simply say Improve.

Now compare the two:

-   How to improve pacman download speed using alternative download
    managers
-   Improve pacman download speed using alternative download managers

> Rewording long parts

The text Improve pacman download speed is rather long. Instead, we will
say Speed up pacman download

Now compare:

-   Improve pacman download speed using alternative download managers
-   Speed up pacman download using alternative download managers

> Avoid fancy words

Fancy words (like alternative in our example) are not only fancy; they
are used less often than ordinary words, and thus tend to be longer. It
is well known that words that are used regularly are in most cases
shorter, so try to find an ordinary alternative for your words.

Instead of saying alternative, you may say other.

Compare the two versions:

-   Speed up pacman download using alternative download managers
-   Speed up pacman download using other download managers

> Deviating from formal technical expressions

This may be frowned upon by some of the more technically oriented users,
but most people would not mind at all. Avoid technical terms if that
makes your article names shorter.

Instead of saying download managers, you may say downloaders.

Compare:

-   Speed up pacman download using other download managers
-   Speed up pacman download using other downloaders

> Review the result

Do not get too excited yet. We still need to review the two titles and
see if they still communicate the same meaning.

-   How to improve pacman download speed using alternative download
    managers
-   Speed up pacman download using other downloaders

Okay, we see the end result is a much shorter article name, but what
about its meaning? Well, it certainly seems like we did a good job. But
now we have a different problem. pacman is not a downloader; both
alternative download managers and other downloaders imply that pacman is
a downloader, which is not what we want. We need to change the meaning
by saying external downloaders.

Compare:

-   How to improve pacman download speed using alternative download
    managers
-   Speed up pacman download using other downloaders
-   Speed up pacman download using external downloaders

Multi-language articles
-----------------------

Non-English names are required to have a language identifier.

To facilitate administration and inter-language linking, non-English
articles should use titles of the form Title in English (Language) where
"Language" is the localized spelling of said language. A redirect with a
localized title can and should be added for convenience. See Help:i18n
for details.

> Example

For example, if you have an article called pacman, you would call the
Japanese translation pacman (日本語), and the Serbian translation pacman
(Српски).
