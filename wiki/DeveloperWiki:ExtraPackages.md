Adding Packages to Extra
========================

Because we have limited man power, and limited mirror space, it is
important that we keep the packages in the [extra] repository under
control. Packages can always go into community as opposed to extra.

> Ask First

The policy here is very simple. Ask the other devs.

-   Send a short mail to the arch-dev-public list with your intent to
    add a new package to [extra]
-   Wait for a few replies to see if anyone takes issue with it.
    Generally, it's probably good to wait a few hours, as timezones
    differ between the team quite a bit.
-   Assuming no one takes issue with the package, add it to extra.
