unused packages.

proposal to make [community] use the same repository system as [core] or
[extra].

> Minimum Vote Requirement

1.  Votes are an indicator of package interest or usage. They aren't an
    absolute indicator.
2.  There are almost three hundred packages in community with less than
    two votes.
3.  If a package has any significant usage it should really have at
    least three votes.
4.  If users realise that votes do have more of an impact they may be
    encouraged vote.
5.  Hundreds of unused packages will cause unneeded strain on the
    community server's resources.
6.  If the number of packages are allowed to increase without limit we
    would need unlimited resources.
7.  Increasing resources costs money. Increasing resources without limit
    requires an unlimited supply of money.
8.  This plan costs no money to implement.
9.  Package Statistics
10. AUR packages sorted by ascending votes

Plan of Action

1.  Let users know that votes will be counted via mailing list and forum
    and packages with few votes will be moved to unsupported.
2.  Provide a deadline when packages will be moved so users can
    anticipate the change and vote if they need to.
3.  Move all packages with zero votes that are not dependencies of other
    non-zero vote packages.
4.  Move all packages with only one vote...
5.  And so on.

Maintenance

When adding a package, the Trusted User should consider the number of
votes that a package has. If the package has a low number of votes (less
than three (3)) then it should not be included in community.

Community should be checked periodically to ensure that it does not
contain packages with votes below the minimum requirement.

The minimum number of votes required for a package to be included in
community may be changed with a vote by Trusted Users.

Exceptions

-   Sometimes a package might be required in community because it is a
    dependency of a more popular package.
-   Internationalisation packages that are required to make a more
    popular package useful for certain language users.
-   More exceptions may be added on a general basis.
