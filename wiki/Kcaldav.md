If you want to connect your google calendar with korganizer you need

the caldav service.

Now you can import your google calendar into korganizer:

-   open korganizer (or kontact)
-   click on the green '+' symbol to add a new calendar
-   select CalDAV server from the list of available types
-   address is: " https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/[calendar
    name]/events/ "
    -   you can get the calendar name, when you open google calendar in
        your browser, then go to

My calendars click on the down arrow for the calendar you want to import
and select Calendar settings

-   -   copy the name of the calendar; the default name would be
        <name>@gmail.com

-   enter your username and password in the appropriate fields

Now you should be able to use google calendar from within korganizer.
