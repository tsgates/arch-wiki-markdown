Acer Aspire 5560G-7809
======================

An affordable gaming laptop. The 5560G-7809 has an integrated GPU and a
dedicated one a AMD 7640M. It's a good video card for a laptop in 2012
for gaming. It is part of the Southern Islands (HD 7xxx) series. Since
North Island (released beginning of 2011) still hasnt' gotten the full
features implemented almost two years after release for the open-source
driver, I don't expect the 7640M feature matrix to be complete until
about 2014 sometime. Since I like gaming I will have to use the Catylyst
driver.
