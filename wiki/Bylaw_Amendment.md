Standard Voting Procedure (SVP) describes the formal procedure used by
TUs to accept or reject proposals regarding TU affairs.

SVP begins with a proposal, for example the addition of a TU or an
amendment to the bylaws. The proposal should be clear and concise and it
must be posted on the aur-general mailing list (aur-general). The
proposal must also be worded unambiguously, and such that a YES or NO
answer may be given.

The discussion period begins when the proposal is posted on aur-general.
The duration of the discussion period shall be 5 full days UNLESS
otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal.
Official discussion shall take place on aur-general. During the
discussion period, votes shall not be cast.

The voting period begins when the discussion period ends. The duration
of the voting period shall be 7 full days UNLESS otherwise stated in a
section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal. During the voting
period, TUs may vote YES, NO or ABSTAIN. Votes shall be cast under the
Trusted User section of the AUR homepage. At the end of the voting
period, all votes shall be tallied.

In the context of SVP, TUs are considered active if they are marked as
active when the voting period ends.

Quorum shall be 66% of all active TUs and participation shall be
measured by the sum of YES, NO and ABSTAIN votes, UNLESS otherwise
stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the proposal.

The proposal is accepted if EITHER

     A) the number of YES votes is greater than half the number of active TUs OR
     B) quorum has been established and the number of YES votes is greater than the number of NO votes

UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the
proposal.

The proposal is rejected if EITHER

     A) the number of NO votes is greater than or equal to the number of active TUs have voted NO OR
     B) quorum was established and the number of NO votes is greater than or equal to the number of YES votes

UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the
proposal.

A rejected proposal may not be presented again before a waiting period
has passed. The duration of the waiting period shall be 3 full months
UNLESS otherwise stated in a section of the bylaws pertaining to the
proposal. The waiting period begins at the end of the voting period.

If quorum is not established by the end of the voting period then the
proposal is neither accepted nor rejected. A second SVP shall begin to
establish the status of the proposal. If the proposal is not accepted at
the end of the second SVP then it shall be rejected.
