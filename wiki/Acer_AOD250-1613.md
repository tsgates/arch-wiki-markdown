Not Losing Android
------------------

> Quick Review

Not losing Android, as far as I understand, requires some effort on your
part. Here is the gist: do NOT install the bootloader to the MBR but to
the partition where you installed Arch.

Caution: You always risk losing data when you are moving or resizing a
partition. Don't start the procedure if you do not have a back up, are
not sure whether e-recovery (alt+f10 while booting) may work (I do not
know if this model has it), do not have recovery CDs ($20 from Acer,
does not come with the netbook), or just do not want to risk it.

> Details

When you first turn on your AOD-250 (d250 with android), you will see
that it has three partitions:

-   /dev/sda1 -> "Compaq Diagnostic" (ie System Recovery partition)
-   /dev/sda2 -> NTFS (Windows XP)
-   /dev/sda3 -> FAT32 (Android)

I am not quite sure how, but the boot process is initially handled by
Acer's tools, not Windows XP's bootloader (NTLDR). In fact, ubuntu's
Gparted version identifies this tool as a hidden Windows Vista
bootloader. Acer's tool first looks at whether you want (set up) Android
to start. If you did, it starts Android up. If you chose Xindows XP, it
tells NTLDR to load Windows XP up. So, as far as I understand, if you
install another bootloader to the MBR, you lose Android (I did not try
it though -I didn't want to take the risk).

So here is what I did:

1. Boot using Ubuntu LiveCD USB (because it had an up to date gparted at
time of this writing) to:

-   shrink Windows' partition to 20G
-   move /dev/sda3 right after /dev/sda2, so that when I create new
    partitions, the partition number (sda3) will not change.
-   create new partitions for Arch installation

2. Install Arch as usual, but tell it to install bootloader to the
partition where Arch was installed. In other words, if you install Arch
to /dev/sda6, choose /dev/sda6 as the place to install grub when it asks
you.

3. Boot with Ubuntu LiveCD USB again to copy the bootloader to a usb
disk. If you installed Arch to /dev/sda6:

     dd if=/dev/sda6 of=/path/to/usb/drive/arch.mbr bs=512 count=1

The name of the file should have less than 7 characters, follow DOS file
name limitations (keep it simple).

4. Restart: Windows XP will boot. Copy arch.mbr to C:\ (root of
Windows).

5. Edit Windows' bootloader to add Arch to NTLDR's list of operating
systems that can be booted up. Open up Windows' terminal window and

     cd \
     attrib -s -h -r BOOT.INI
     notepad BOOT.INI

and add a line at the end of that file, like this:

     c:\arch.mbr="Arch Linux"

and finish the edit by saving the file and fixing its attributes again

     attrib +s +h +r BOOT.INI

6. Have Arch be the default OS to boot for NTLDR: use msconfig to set
the default entry (find the BOOT.INI tab, click on the line that says,
for example, c:\arch.mbr="Arch Linux", and click on "Set as Default".
You may also want to change the time out value for NTLDR, see
http://vlaurie.com/computers2/Articles/bootini.htm which has nice
screenshots on various things to do with the bootloader.

CPUFREQ and Wrong CPU Freq Reporting
------------------------------------

When you load acpi-cpufreq to do cpu frequency scaling, the maximum CPU
speed becomes 1.33GHz instead of 1.66Ghz. There is no workaround for
this at time of writing except not using said module, which is not
helpful in terms of saving power (battery life for the session). See
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cpufreqd/+bug/422858

Mounting Android from Linux as a Loop Device
--------------------------------------------

This section requires someone to elaborate on what really is happening
here.

Assuming that Android is in your /dev/sda3 partition and that you have
an fstab entry that mounts Androids partition as a vfat filesystem to a
folder called /android, I think you mount Android as a loopback device
when you do:

       $ mkdir ~/android-loop #you only need to do this once
       # mount /android
       # mount -t loop /android/firefox.img ~/android-loop
