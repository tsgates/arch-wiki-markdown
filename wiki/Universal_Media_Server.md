Universal Media Server
======================

Universal Media Server is a DLNA-compliant UPnP Media Server. It is
based on PS3 Media Server by shagrath. It is actually an evolution of
the "SubJunk Build" of PMS. UMS was started by SubJunk, an official
developer of PMS, in order to ensure greater stability and
file-compatibility.

Because it is written in Java, Universal Media Server supports all major
operating systems, with versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The
program streams or transcodes many different media formats with little
or no configuration. It is powered by MEncoder, FFmpeg, tsMuxeR,
AviSynth, MediaInfo and more, which combine to offer support for a wide
range of media formats.

Installation
------------

Universal Media Server is available in the AUR via ums.

Configuration
-------------

UMS can be run on a per-user basis. Run the executable at
/opt/ums/UMS.sh once, then edit the config file at
~/.config/UMS/UMS.conf. The port, folders, and minimized options in
UMS.conf are especially noteworthy.
