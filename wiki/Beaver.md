Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR. Beaver is a GTK+2 editor designed to
be:

 Light-weight
    Beaver starts up fast and doesn't use a lot of memory. Beaver's only
    dependency is GTK+2, so no need to install other libraries eating
    your disk space. These things make Beaver very suitable for old
    computers and use in small Linux distributions.

 Modular
    The Beaver core just supplies basic functionality and syntax
    highlighting. Additional functionality can be found in plugins,
    which are available on our Plugins page. This way, we make it
    possible for you to customize Beaver to your personal flavour.

 Stylish
    A clean interface, enabling you to do your work efficiently, and
    high-quality Tango artwork.
