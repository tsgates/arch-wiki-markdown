Forum Etiquette
===============

These guidelines have been developed over time based on the extensive
experience of the moderation team with input by the community. The Arch
forums are no-nonsense in nature.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Common Sense Introduction
-------------------------

-   If you choose to use the Arch Linux distribution, you are welcomed,
    and encouraged to embrace The Arch Way.
-   When asking for help, read the manual, do your research and provide
    details for those you are asking for assistance.
-   When offering help, be as patient and tactful as possible.

-   Arch is a community of volunteers. Therefore, this entire document
    may be condensed into one simple admonition:

Proactively seek to give of yourself and to bring only benefit to your
peers and community.

Personal Topics/Rants
---------------------

Rants and complaints are frowned on and may be closed as they are
discovered. Posts of this type are much better suited for a blog or
other personal web space and are unwanted on the Arch forums. Public
posts should be open, productive and inviting to all members.
Discussions among a select group of users should take place in private
message.

Ineffective Discussion (BIKESHED)
---------------------------------

Threads stating the equivalent of "there is a problem with the Arch
system and methodology, we need to discuss it" have been repeatedly
proven ineffective and inflammatory and will usually be locked after a
warning from the moderation team. Arch is a Do It Yourself community. If
you have identified a systemic issue, find a solution that works for
you, implement it, then post.

Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the Arch
Linux development team will be monitored closely and locked if deemed
unhelpful and/or unproductive. Harsh, unproductive criticism is also
uncalled for.

If you have a question regarding Arch development, please ensure that
your topic poses a specific question and be open-minded to responses. If
possible, provide a solution or partial solution. Submitting code and
patches for discussion is always more pragmatic than asking others to do
it for you.

Be Responsible
--------------

If an interpersonal issue arises, please be open-minded to the
possibility that your behavior may have contributed to the problem.
Taking responsibility for our actions is often a good first step toward
a peaceful reconciliation.

Respect Other Users
-------------------

Simply put, treat others as you would be treated; respect them and their
views, even if you disagree with them.

Respect Other Distributions and Operating Systems
-------------------------------------------------

Maligning other GNU/Linux distributions, operating systems, or users
thereof is prohibited. The entire Arch team is happy to volunteer their
time and energy to provide you with the Arch Linux distribution,
documentation and forums. Kindly show respect toward the volunteers,
users and communities of other distributions and operating systems as
well. Views, experiences and opinions are always welcome, but
unproductive slander is not.

Pasting Pictures and Code
-------------------------

Please use [code] tags when pasting console snippets. Please use
http://pastebin.com/ when posting large amounts of code. For non-English
locale users: Please prepend LC_ALL=C to posted commands so that the
output will be in English. Do not post full screen pictures; use
thumbnails instead. Any image with dimensions greater than 250x250px or
over 50Kb in size will be removed.

Product Recommendation Requests
-------------------------------

Threads seeking advice about computer product recommendations are
discouraged. Such topics, like the technology they discuss, quickly
become obsolete and are unlikely to provide any lasting benefit to the
wider community. You are expected to be able to do your own research and
draw your own conclusions about which product best suits your individual
requirements.

Advertising/Solicitation
------------------------

Publicity for a cause or the promotion of goods and/or services will be
monitored closely. Generally, if it is related to Arch (as a project or
community) or GNU/Linux/FOSS, it will usually be allowed. Web-invites,
plugging, blog-type or commercial promotions are typically discouraged,
or outright prohibited. Also be aware that posting shortened/obscured
links is a technique of spammers and deliberately inhibits the
communities ability to judge the propriety of the link. Therefore,
please only post links that include a clear destination. If unsure about
the appropriateness of your content, contact the moderation team before
posting.

Homework
--------

As a matter of principle, do not ask for homework answers, nor post
answers to such requests. Homework assignments are designed to encourage
a student to learn by their own personal research. Topics deemed to be
about homework will be closed.

Old Threads/"Necro-Bumping"
---------------------------

Do your part to keep the forums tidy. Posting in old threads, or
"necrobumping" is generally discouraged in the technical issue
subforums, since it can potentially create disjointed "zombie"
information; outdated posts with data which is no longer relevant due to
Arch's rolling nature, combined with more recent posts reflecting more
current circumstance. Furthermore, technical support threads should
remain succinct, and multiple pages are to be avoided if possible.

Rules of thumb

-   If you have a question, start a new thread and link to the old if
    relevant.
-   If you have something to add and judge that your information is
    related, but more up-to-date, start a new thread and link to the old
    if desired, but avoid duplicating effort by posting information
    already contained in the Arch wiki.
-   If you have a version-agnostic or corresponding solution,
    necrobumping can be appropriate.

Forum Member Accounts
---------------------

Please limit your forum membership to one account only. Having multiple
accounts is an unnecessary use of resources. Further, it may be
interpreted as trolling behavior.

No Trolling
-----------

A "troll" is a person who intentionally attempts to disrupt, cause
controversy, incite an argument, and/or receive negative attention by
deliberately posting provocative content. The term may also refer to the
act of posting such content, or the content itself.

Trolls are generally deceitful and often use ambivalence as a method of
covertly insulting, intimidating, or inciting a person or persons for
their own sadistic pleasure. They often pick their words very carefully
and are therefore able to defend their masked attempts at creating
unrest, frequently redirecting the blame onto the community and its
supposed failure to understand them properly. Trolling is strictly
prohibited.

Avoid Controversy/Controversial Topics
--------------------------------------

There is no explicit list of topics considered to be "trollish",
controversial or provocative, but in the past, threads with posts
pertaining to Religion, Sports, Race, Nationalism and Politics have
invariably been closed. Therefore, specifically avoid these and all
divisive topics on the Arch forums! The forum staff certainly realize
that such issues are deeply ingrained human realities. However, this is
a GNU/Linux distribution forum and is not intended nor able to
effectively facilitate such commentary nor the resulting unrest.

No Power-Posting/Empty Posts
----------------------------

Power-posting is best described as posting empty and worthless messages.
It is not tolerated. People may have two reasons to do this: to increase
their post count meaninglessly, or to lend support to an idea as if it
were a vote. Examples of power-posting include, but are not limited to,
replying with "+1", "lol", "me too", "I agree", or ":)".

When posting or replying to messages, make sure you have something to
say. These empty posts clutter up threads and discussion, invalidate the
'Show New Posts' function, and waste bandwidth and server space.

Threads that degenerate into a series of "+1/-1" or "me too/I agree/I
disagree" will be locked. Individual power posts may also be deleted.

Life is a Two-way Street
------------------------

A simple, yet profound and undeniable truth. Ensure your thread includes
details and information that others will find useful. Share your
findings with the community. Share your failures as well. Posting the
equivalent of "Nevermind, I fixed it." in your thread or deleting your
own posts for similar reasons is not only selfish and useless to the
community, but a complete waste of resources and everyone's time. Also,
demanding help or showing an obvious impatience toward getting it is
unwanted here. Arch is provided by a community of volunteers. Arch users
are strongly encouraged to do research, make an effort, report back in
the thread, help others, get involved, and contribute to the community.

Please do not be a "help vampire".

Bumping
-------

Posting a single word or useless message (bumping) to attract attention
to your thread is not allowed. Do your own research, continue to
troubleshoot, post the results, and be patient with the community. If
people are reading your thread without answering or offering help, you
may try supplying more details, or ask to be pointed in the right
direction. Often, the reason for posts remaining unanswered is due in
large part to the sparse details in the original post itself, or, the
obvious availability of solutions in the wiki, on the forum or on the
web, and the community's unwillingness to point out the obvious.

Cross-Posting
-------------

Cross-posting is posting the same question multiple times in different
subforums (for example, posting in both Newbie Corner and Installation).
This is a waste of resources and is not permitted. Any cross-posted
topic will be immediately locked or deleted.

Arch Linux Distribution Support ONLY
------------------------------------

Arch-based distributions often use different packages, package versions,
repositories, and make custom system configurations surreptitiously,
constituting support for such projects quite impossible on the Arch
forums. Community technical support shall only be provided for the Arch
Linux distribution and the Arch User Repository. Threads concerning
issues with, and requesting support for, derivate distributions, or
operating systems other than Arch Linux are strictly prohibited and will
be closed.

Misplaced Posts
---------------

Try to place your posts in the correct forum for the topic. Our forums
have been carefully categorized so that most topics fit in one logical
location. Any post that is deemed by the staff to be in the wrong forum
will be moved to the correct location without warning. Most users can
find these on their own but if you lose your thread, it is acceptable to
contact one of the forum advisers asking where it has been moved.

Thread Hijacking
----------------

Thread hijacking is the process of replying to an existing thread with a
different topic. This is generally discouraged. It is better to start a
new thread if you have a problem that is related to an existing posted
issue but clearly different. Posts that hijack a serious thread with
off-topic discussion are also discouraged.

Spam
----

A blight upon the face of the net, spam is forbidden. Please report spam
with the forum report function and a moderator will review it for
removal. Offending spam accounts and associated IP addresses will be
banned. Do not reply to spam posts as it increases the amount of work
required to clean them up.

Do Not Flame
------------

Flaming, in the most common sense definition, is directing negative,
disrespectful, and/or insulting comments toward someone. An equally or
more negative response, resulting in a cycling exchange of insults is
often the consequence. Flaming fellow members (including the Arch team)
will not be tolerated. Never resort to personal insults and please avoid
sarcastic and patronizing language. Discussions can be productive, but
quarreling is always destructive.

Respect The Staff
-----------------

Members of The Forum Team have been chosen for their ability to exercise
consistently good judgment and shall have the final say. Note that this
forum is not run as a democracy. The forum staff shall always attempt to
implement universally peaceful solutions, but in the end, are charged
with the responsibility of maintaining peaceful, civil order for the
forum majority. Therefore, they cannot always please everyone with the
decisions made. Please do your part to contribute to a healthy community
and environment.

-   If you feel that an egregious oversight has been made, do NOT post
    complaints in forum threads - they will be quickly closed.
    Alternatively, use the forum report function, email a member of the
    moderator group, or email forum@archlinux.org to contact the forum
    admins.

Warnings, User Locking, Banning
-------------------------------

If the Arch Forum Moderation Team feels that a member's behavior is
unacceptable and warrants intervention, a warning will typically be
issued unless the occurrence is judged to be especially flagrant, in
which case a ban may become imminent. Warnings will not be discussed on
the Arch Forums, IRC channels, or mailing lists by the Moderation Team.
If the warning goes unheeded, further action will be taken. This may
range from locking the offending user account, to deletion or banning of
the user, out of consideration for a peaceful forum and community.
Action is generally on a case-by-case basis.

If a user is apologetic, interested in a peaceful solution and wishes to
have their account reinstated, a general consensus will be formed by the
moderation team for, or against, such a request.

How to Post
-----------

-   Choose clear, informative subjects. This is more likely to elicit
    response from experienced users who have knowledge about that
    particular topic. It also makes the topic easy to reference and find
    in forum searches by future users with similar problems. Further,
    avoid extraneous phrases such as [HELP!], [URGENT], etc.
-   A sincere effort to use modest and proper language and grammar is a
    sign of respect toward the community that will certainly be
    appreciated and is quite likely to elicit positive responses. Please
    refrain from using so-called "textspeak", "netspeak", "leetspeak"
    and all other forms of internet slang.
-   When asking questions, provide as much information as possible,
    including error messages, terminal output, logs, what you have
    previously tried, what documentation and searches you have
    attempted, and related configuration files.
-   Choose one topic per thread. Long threads are typically discouraged
    in the technical issue subforums.
-   Post your question in only one subforum; pick the most relevant, and
    post there.
-   When responding to an existing thread, always read the original post
    and attempt to focus on the original topic.
-   Finally, when a solution is found, mark your thread as solved by
    editing the first post and prepending the tag [SOLVED] to the title
    in the "Subject" field.   
     Note that you should avoid using [CLOSED], which is instead used by
    the system to mark a thread which is no longer accessible for new
    posts.
-   If a thread is marked as [SOLVED], do not reply stating the
    equivalent of "I am having a similar issue.."; start a new thread
    and link to the [SOLVED] thread, if relevant.

Dustbin Policy (Marked for Deletion)
------------------------------------

Threads that are locked/closed because they are either already
documented on the boards or Wiki or are inconsistent with the Arch Way
will be moved to Dust/troll-bin. After a period of five days, the thread
will be deleted. The Moderator responsible will clearly mark the thread
as "Binned" or "For deletion."

Legality
--------

Criminal solicitation is strictly forbidden on this website. In this
context, "criminal solicitation" shall mean, "To actively or passively
inform about, facilitate, incite, move, or persuade others to some act
of lawlessness or illegal activity."

Therefore, do not post discussions about or link to criminal
solicitation in any form. This includes, but is not limited to
information or links to facilitate illegal drug use, theft, network
intrusion, creation of code for malignant purposes, prohibited software
copying, prohibited use of copyrighted/patented material, so-called
"warez", or sites which provide torrents or links to such content.
Illegal content will be removed swiftly and dealt with in full
accordance with known applicable law.

Freedom
-------

The free and open exchange of assistance, speech, ideas and opinions is
highly regarded and encouraged on the forums, but it must be noted that
the freedom granted to forum members is relative freedom. It exists
within the boundaries of the above guidelines and principles. Complaints
of censorship are therefore baseless and unfounded, since this necessary
framework must simultaneously provide reasonable limitations. To
illustrate, we are aware of the physical laws which govern energy and
matter, yet we do not complain of their oppression. Instead, we
recognize that such laws are essential for our welfare. Likewise, the
Arch community's high standards reflected in these guidelines regulate
community freedom for the common good and protection of all. The key,
then, to true freedom on the forums is to cultivate benevolence toward
others and harmonize our attitude with the Arch Way by bringing only
benefit to our peers. In addition, this allows members to satisfy all
contributive impulses without aggravating themselves or encroaching on
the freedom of others. Embracing the above principles and obeying the
forum guidelines therefore benefits the entire community by providing
freedom from the harmful and negative consequences of a more chaotic
approach.
